The purpose of this project was to create a password generator that allows users to choose a random or memorable password. In order to use this project, the user will have to first choose whether they want a memorable or random password, then they will go through multiple text prompts depending on which password they want. Once they have filled each text prompt, they will recieve a password that is added to either the "memorable" or "random" dictionary in the "Generated_Passwords.txt" file, along with the time and date they were created. I used the Random module, the String module, and Operating System Library module.
